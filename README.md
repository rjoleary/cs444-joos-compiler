### Attribution

The lexer in (src/haskell/Lexer.hs)[src/haskell/Lexer.hs] is based on
the paper
[Monadic Parsing in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf). We
also adopted the improvements outlined in
[Revisiting 'Monadic Parsing in Haskell](http://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2018/02/04/revisiting-monadic-parsing-haskell/).
