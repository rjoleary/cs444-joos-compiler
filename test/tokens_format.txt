The tokens file is written by the lexer and read by the parser. Each line in
the file has three whitespace separated fields:

        <lexeme> <start_index> <end_index>

The end_index is exclusive so that start_index < end_index.

The start_index and end_index are measured in *bytes* from the beginning of the
input with the first byte in the file being the zeroth index. "\r\n" line
separators count as two indices.

For an example, See appel_tokens.txt for the tokenisation of appel_input.txt.
